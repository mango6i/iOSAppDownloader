## Why This Exists

The original Go [ipatool](https://github.com/majd/ipatool) and many forks broke after Apple changed authentication endpoints.
`ipatool-rs` keeps the same practical goal: log in with an Apple ID, search the App Store, obtain free licenses, and download IPA files.

This rewrite adds a keyboard-driven terminal UI, structured Rust models, clearer errors, streaming downloads, and retry/reauth flows for unstable App Store responses.

## Comparison

| Feature | [ipatool](https://github.com/majd/ipatool) (Go) | ipatool-rs (this project) |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Apple ID authentication | ❌ Broken since 2024 auth changes | ✅ Works with current endpoints |
| Two-factor authentication | ❌ Broken | ✅ Supported |
| Interactive TUI | ❌ CLI only | ✅ Full keyboard-driven TUI |
| Download progress | ❌ None | ✅ Progress bar + streaming |
| HTTP Range resume | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (CLI mode) |
| Background download queue | ❌ No | ✅ TUI downloads tab |
| Session auto-refresh | ❌ No | ✅ Re-auths on expired token |
| Credential storage | File-based | ✅ OS keychain (macOS/Linux/Windows) |
| Output formats | text | text + JSON |
| Single binary | ✅ | ✅ |
| Windows support | ✅ | ✅ |

## Features

- Interactive TUI mode: run `ipatool` to open tabs for Search, Library, Downloads, and Account.
- Search-to-download workflow: browse App Store results, inspect app details, purchase free licenses, and queue downloads from one screen.
- Download dashboard: track progress, failures, cancellation, and completed items in the Downloads tab.
- Account management: log in, handle 2FA, view the active account, and revoke stored credentials.
- Resilient sessions: refresh expired tokens during purchase and download flows when stored credentials are available.
- Robust downloads: stream IPA files with progress display and HTTP Range resume support in CLI mode.
- Patch-ready IPAs: inject purchase metadata and SINF authorization data into the downloaded archive.
- Signed sign-in: performs Apple's SAP handshake, which is required for `auth login` to work at all since August 2026.
- Text or JSON output for scripts and automation.

### Build From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kosthi/ipatool-rs.git
cd ipatool-rs
cargo build --release

# Binary at target/release/ipatool
```

## Usage

### Terminal UI

Launch the TUI by running `ipatool` without a subcommand.

```bash
ipatool
```

The UI is built with [ratatui](https://ratatui.rs/) and [crossterm](https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm). It provides a fast keyboard workflow for login, search, purchase, download progress, and cancellation.

### CLI

Log in with your Apple ID. Two-factor authentication is supported.

> **First sign-in downloads ~50 MB.** Apple requires sign-in requests to be
> signed, and producing that signature means running Apple's own code (see
> [How It Works](#how-it-works)). The pieces are fetched once, verified against
> pinned SHA-256 digests, and cached under `~/.ipatool/cache/`; later sign-ins
> reuse them. Delete that directory to force a re-download.

```bash
# Interactive login (prompts for a 2FA code if Apple requires one)
ipatool auth login --email your@apple.id --password 'password'

# With 2FA code
ipatool auth login --email your@apple.id --password 'password' --auth-code 123456

# Show current account
ipatool auth info

# Log out and clear credentials
ipatool auth revoke
```

Search for apps on the App Store.

```bash
ipatool search "WeChat" --limit 10
ipatool search "Telegram" --limit 5 --country US
```

Obtain a free license for an app.

```bash
ipatool purchase -b com.tencent.xin
```

Download an IPA file. Use `--purchase` to automatically obtain the license before downloading.
By default, the IPA is saved in the current working directory as `{bundle_id}_{app_id}_{version}.ipa`.
Use `-o` to choose a different output path.

```bash
# Download with auto-purchase
ipatool download -b com.tencent.xin --purchase

# Specify output path
ipatool download -b com.tencent.xin --purchase -o ~/Downloads/wechat.ipa

# Download by app ID
ipatool download -i 414478124 --purchase

# Download a specific version
ipatool download -b com.tencent.xin --version-id 12345
```

List available versions and retrieve version metadata.

```bash
# List all versions
ipatool version list -b com.tencent.xin

# Get metadata for a specific version
ipatool version meta -b com.tencent.xin --version-id 12345
```

## How It Works

1. **Auth** - Posts credentials to Apple's MZFinance endpoint, signed with an `X-Apple-ActionSignature`. Since August 2026 Apple rejects unsigned sign-in requests with an empty 403, so the signature is mandatory. Handles 2FA, pod redirects, retry logic, keychain storage, and cookies.

   Producing the signature means running Apple's own signing code. On first use, ipatool-rs range-reads a public OS X 10.9 update package (~33 MB of 1.27 GB) to extract `CommerceKit`, `CommerceCore` and `CoreFP`, downloads a prebuilt [Unicorn](https://www.unicorn-engine.org/) emulator, and runs those x86-64 binaries in-process with their imports serviced from Rust. Everything is verified against pinned SHA-256 digests before it is executed and cached under `~/.ipatool/cache/`. No Apple code is redistributed with this tool.

2. **Search/Lookup** - Queries the public iTunes Search API for app metadata and storefront-specific results.

3. **Purchase** - Sends a buy request to `buy.itunes.apple.com` with STDQ pricing and falls back to GAME for Apple Arcade-style responses.

4. **Download** - Fetches the download URL and DRM data from Apple's `volumeStoreDownloadProduct` endpoint, then streams the IPA.

5. **Patch** - Rebuilds the ZIP, injecting `iTunesMetadata.plist` and SINF files so the IPA can be installed on an authorized device.

6. **TUI** - Wraps the same core APIs in an async ratatui/crossterm interface with background tasks for search, login, purchase, and downloads.

## FAQ

**Is my Apple ID password stored on disk?**

No. After a successful login, ipatool-rs stores only a `password_token` (a session token issued by Apple) plus non-sensitive account metadata. The token is saved in the OS keychain — macOS Keychain, libsecret on Linux, or Windows Credential Manager — not in a plain-text file. Your actual password is never persisted.

**Why does ipatool-rs store the password at all for re-authentication?**

Some Apple Store operations (e.g. re-purchasing after a session expiry) require a full re-login, not just a token refresh. If you logged in interactively, ipatool-rs will prompt you again rather than storing the plain-text password. The `password` field in the keychain entry is only populated when you explicitly provide it via `--password` on the CLI, so re-auth can happen unattended in scripts.

**Does this violate Apple's Terms of Service?**

Downloading apps you have legitimately purchased or obtained a free license for is the same as using the App Store. This tool does not bypass DRM or enable piracy — downloaded IPAs still contain your account's DRM data and will only install on devices authorized under your Apple ID. Review Apple's terms for your specific use case.

**The original ipatool stopped working — is this a drop-in replacement?**

The CLI commands are intentionally similar, but not identical. The main differences are: `auth login` instead of `ipatool auth`, the addition of `--purchase` on download, and the new TUI mode. See the Usage section above for the full reference.

**I'm getting a 2FA prompt every time I run a command.**

This usually means the stored token has expired and Apple is requiring a fresh login. Run `ipatool auth login` again. If you're running in a script, use `--non-interactive` and ensure your session is fresh before the run.

**Why does the first login download tens of megabytes?**

Apple now requires sign-in requests to carry a signature that only its own code can produce, so ipatool-rs fetches the Apple frameworks that produce it plus the emulator that runs them. Both are pinned by SHA-256 and cached under `~/.ipatool/cache/` (~50 MB), so this happens once. Nothing is downloaded for search, purchase or download once you are signed in.

**Login fails with "failed to establish a SAP signing session".**

The signing session could not be set up. Re-run with `--verbose` for the underlying cause. If it mentions integrity verification, delete `~/.ipatool/cache/` and try again — a truncated download is the usual reason. If it persists, please open an issue with the verbose output.

**Which countries/storefronts are supported?**

All storefronts supported by the iTunes Search API. Use `--country <ISO-3166-1-alpha-2>` (e.g. `--country US`, `--country CN`) to target a specific store.
